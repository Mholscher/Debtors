""" This module contains a Blueprint for the api access to the debtors system.

Systems outside debtors itself can communicate to the system by sending json\
formatted messages to it. These messages are handled by the views in 
this module.

It also has the url_rules to add to the rule map of wekzeug, so incoming
messages can be dispatched.
